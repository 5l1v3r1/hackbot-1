# hackbot

A customizable Facebook Group embetterment robot.

## Usage

You'll need to set a few configuration options before using the hackbot:

    $ cp config.json.example config.json

Add your Facebook Group ID, the IDs of the group's administrators, and your
long-lived Facebook access token to the configuration file. Currently, there is
no way to update the access token without restarting the hackbot.

To generate an access token, open up the [Facebook Graph API
Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/) and make sure you're
using a custom application. Click "Get Access Token" and make sure the
`user_groups` and `publish_actions` permissions are ticked. Click the blue "Get
Access Token" in the modal. Copy the short-lived access token and navigate in
your browser to the following URL:

    https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?
        client_id=APP_ID&
        client_secret=APP_SECRET&
        grant_type=fb_exchange_token&
        fb_exchange_token=SHORT_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN

Replace `APP_ID`, `APP_SECRET`, and `SHORT_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the proper
values. Take the long-lived (60 day) access token and place it in
`config.json`. Then you should be good to go!

    $ npm start

Keep in mind that Facebook's user IDs are unique to each application, so you'll
have to find some way of finding out admin IDs using the Graph API.
